Code today. Build tomorrow.
Stay curious. Keep compiling.
Bug by bug, I evolve.
Trust the process, refactor later.
Failure is just precompiled success.
Write code. Write legacy.
Infinite loops. Finite time. Choose wisely.
Every bug is a teacher.
Dream in logic. Build in passion.
Compile your purpose.
